## Data sharing section in consent

\
\
\

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="62%"}
* Data sharing comes with perceived advantages, disadvantages and uncertainties for researchers [@Stieglitz.etal.2020]<br /><br />
* uncertainty: Fear of 
  - **lower participation** or [@Zuiderwijk.etal.2020]
  - **alternation of behavior** [@Steinhardt.etal.2021]<br />due to data-sharing clauses,<br /><br />
* particularly with 
  - certain **data types** (e.g., interview, video) and [@Lamb.etal.2024]
  - **sensitive** topics (e.g., prostitution) [@Beck.2019, p. 23]

## Evidence so far

\
\
\

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="62%"}

* More general challenge: Participants often **don't read** [@Geier.etal.2021; @Parfenova.etal.2024; @Pedersen.etal.2011; @Douglas.etal.2021; @Ittenbach.etal.2015] or **understand** consent forms [@Pietrzykowski.Smilowska.2021]<br /><br /><br />
* Reasons for not reading (-> measure in Study 2a):
  - Too long [@Wisgalla.Hasford.2022; @Perrault.Keating.2018]
  - Too complex [@Wisgalla.Hasford.2022; @Kamath.etal.2025]
  - Unappealing presentation (no segmentation or interactivity) [@Perrault.Keating.2018; @Geier.etal.2021]
  - Assumed low risk of participation [@Perrault.Keating.2018]
  - Trust in researchers [@Ulrich.etal.2024; @Xu.etal.2020]
  - Familiarity with consent forms [@Geier.etal.2021]

## Evidence so far

\
\
\

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="62%"}

* Preliminary evidence
  - **No effect** of data sharing clause on participation [@Fichtner.etal.2023]
  - Participants want their data to be shared, to help science and help others [@Mozersky.etal.2020a; @VandeVusse.etal.2022]
  - Even for very **sensitive** topics, participants agree to share data [@Kuula.2011; @Campbell.etal.2023a]<br /><br /><br />
* **Dialogue** about data sharing increases consent[@Campbell.etal.2023]

## Research Questions 


\
\

1. Do participants **read** informed consent forms?<br /><br />
2. Does the information on **sharing data** influence the participants' willingness to participate?<br />`r fa("long-arrow-right")` moderated my **data type**?<br /><br />
3. Does the **option to clarify** concerns about the informed consent make a difference in the willingness to participate?

Do participants **read**  
informed consent forms?
:::




## Study 1
### Design


* **Re-use** of **log-data** from past online surveys, that...
  - measured dwell time on the consent page,
  - allow re-use of their data according to the informed consent<br /><br />
* **Sample**
  - [Teachers, students, ...]
  - $N_{participants} = ...$ participants
  - from $N_{studies} = ...$ online surveys (*[year begin - year end]*)


## Study 1
### Measures


**Dwell time on consent: Reading speed (as words per minute):**

* 238: average (silent) reading speed (English) [@Brysbaert.2019]
* \> 500-600: loss of information/comprehension (skimming)
* \> 900: information falls out of working memory before being comprehended [@Masson.1983]<br /><br />


**Additional coding**

* Which population? [students, teachers, public, researchers, ...]
* Participants incentivized? How? [none, money, ...]
* Topic of study? [sensitive, somewhat sensitive, not sensitive]

Only authorized researchers will have access, following strict data protection protocols to prevent unauthorized use or breaches. Data will be retained for at least 10 years in accordance with research integrity guidelines.
*Will others be able to identify me and relate my data with my person?* | Whenever possible, your data will be anonymized so that no one can identify you. In cases where anonymization is not feasible (e.g., video recordings or interviews), your data will be securely stored in a specialized research data center. Only authorized researchers who submit a request, transparently detailing their intended use of the data, will be granted access. No other individuals will be able to view or use your data.
*What does data sharing mean? Who will have access to my data in the future, and how will it be used?* | If you consent, your data may be stored in a specialized research data center. Researchers who wish to access the data must submit an application detailing their research plan transparently. Only approved researchers will be granted selective access, and they are required to delete the data after completing their analyses. They are not allowed to further distribute the data. Your data will not be shared with commercial entities or used for purposes unrelated to research.
*If I withdraw my consent, what happens to the data that has already been collected? What if my data has already been analyzed or published?* | You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting the research team. After withdrawal, we will ensure that your data is no longer used in the study. This means that any data that can be linked to you will be fully deleted. However, results that have already been published in scientific research reports cannot be removed. In these publications, no one will be able to identify you.
*Could my data be used in ways that I havenât agreed to or that could harm me?* | Your data will only be used for research purposes that align with ethical and legal standards. It will not be shared with third parties for commercial or unauthorized use. Any reuse of your data by other researchers must comply with strict ethical guidelines to prevent misuse. Researchers who wish to access your data must submit a transparent plan detailing their intended use and sign a contract binding them to this specific purpose only. Access will only be granted after signing this contract. They are not permitted to further distribute the data and must delete it after completing their analyses.
*How can I be sure the data are handled ethically?* | This study has been reviewed and approved by an ethics board to ensure that it meets ethical research standards. This includes evaluating potential risks, ensuring informed consent, and safeguarding participants' rights and well-being.

**Campell (2023)**  

What Are Participantsâ Concerns About Sharing Qualitative Data?  Though several studies suggest participants are open to having their narrative data shared, they also express concerns about the practice. Qualitative inquiry is a deeply relational method built on developing authentic, trusting relationships with participants, however, brief and situationally specific that relationship may be (Hesse-Biber, 2013; Rubin & Rubin, 2011). The degree of trust participants feel with researchers affects what information they choose to disclose, and they may not want all details shared with others (Broom et al., 2009; Campbell et al., 2019; Feldman & Shaw, 2019). For example, Yardley et al. (2014) conducted focus groups with research participants to discuss their views on sharing qualitative data with other researchers, and the degree of trust and intimacy they felt with researchers was a salient factor. The act of meeting directly with an interviewer and the back-and-forth dialog inherent in narrative methods helped them feel more comfortable disclosing details about their lives, and they expressed hesitancy that others might have access to that information. As a participant in that study noted, âBut the thought that the stuff that I have could go off to another team at another time in another place [for] a completely different purpose is something I would want to balk atâ (p. 106). Yardley et al. (2014) noted that participants remained open to the practice of sharing narrative data with other researchers, but they wanted to be informed ahead of time so they could decide how much to disclose in their interviews. Participants have also expressed concerns about how their privacy and confidentiality would be protected if their qualitative narratives were available to other researchers (Mozersky, Parsons, et al., 2020; VandeVusse et al., 2022; Yardley et al., 2014). In studies on sensitive topics (e.g., health, sexuality, victimization), participants were keenly concerned about the risk of re-identification and the consequences that might befall them. In Mozersky, Walsh, et al.âs (2020) study, 67% of participants expressed concerns about the risks of re-identification, including embarrassment, stigma, judgment, discrimination, and the possibility of identity theft. The risk of re-identification is higher with dyadic data, whereby the events being studied are necessarily known to another person as they are interpersonal interactions (Campbell et al., 2019; Finkel et al., 2015). In qualitative studies of violence and victimization (which are inherently dyadic), re-identification could pose significant safety threats to survivors (Campbell et al., 2019). Finkel et al. (2015) cautioned that some individuals may try to access data and breach confidentiality because they have ill-intent toward study participants. Thus, the risks of sharing qualitative data can be substantial, and there has been minimal research on how participants view these risks when deciding whether to agree to share their data.

## Questions
\
\

**General:** Idea for a journal? -> registered report?
\

**Study 1:** How to ideally collect log-data from past online surveys -> ask in LLiB?  
\
  
**Study 2:** How to collect participants? Panel provider probably biased  
\
  
**Study 2b:** What if participants don't read the fictitious example? -> ecological validity? internal validity?
\
  
**Study 2c:** What does CG do?

## Feedback (Lab Report)

- Concerns: Teilnehmende bringen eher diffuse concerns mit "ich habe angst, dass andere Ã¼ber mich lachen", die vorgeschlagenen concerns sind sehr spezifisch RDM
- Unsere Responses auf die Concerns 
	- passivkonstruktionen, zu sehr RDM-orientiert
	- zu abstrakt
	- Sind unsere Responses formuliert, um die Teilnahme zu steigern oder ehrlich? (z.B. kÃ¶nnen die Daten leaken? Eigentlich nicht, potentiell aber immer ja)
  - Mehr dialogisch, persÃ¶nlich, "bring out the people in our research" (there are people that collect your data...)
  - Antworten in Einfacher Sprache?
- Sind wir wirklich an concerns interessiert (emotional level and response) oder eher an misconceptions (informational level and response)
- Study 2c: Additional control variable: Experiences with studies
- nicht nur "willingness to participate", sondern auch "willingness to share data" abfragen -> Ã¤quivalent zu vielen informed consent Formaten, die beides separat abfragen
