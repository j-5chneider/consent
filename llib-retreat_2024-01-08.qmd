## Design of consent

\
\
\

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="62%"}
* Fear of **lower participation** due to data-sharing clauses,
* particularly with certain **data types** (e.g., video data)<br />`r fa("long-arrow-right")` Challenge for data sharing practices<br /><br /><br /><br />
* Would participants actually **agree less**?<br /><br />
* Does participants' **understanding** align with that of the researchers?

## Design of consent

\
\
\

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="62%"}

* More general challenge: Evidence that participants often **don't read/understand** consent forms<br /><br /><br />
* Evidence so far: 
   - Comprehension varies with **reading level, interactivity**<br />
   - **Dialogue** about data sharing increases consent<br />`r fa("long-arrow-right")` may be challenging with larger sample size<br />`r fa("long-arrow-right")` option for automated response?

## Research Questions 

1. Do participants understand informed consent forms in the same way researchers intend?<br /><br />
2. Does the information on sharing data (containing vs. not containing a section on data being shared) in the informed consent influence the participants' willingness to participate? (for different data types?)<br /><br />
3. Does the option to clarify concerns about the informed consent make a difference in the willingness to participate?


## Study 1

* Design: 2x2 between-subjects design with randomized conditions
* Factors: Consent with different 
  - reading level (standard vs. easy-to-read)
  - interactivity (display-only vs. quiz-format).
* Measures:
  - Dwell time
  - Self-reported reading engagement
  - Understanding (via multiple-choice)
  
## Study 2

* Design: 2x3 between-subjects design with randomized conditions:
* Factors: 
  - Data-sharing section (included vs. not included) 
  - data collection format (video recording vs. interview vs. survey)
* Measure: Willingness to participate (6-point Likert scale)


## Study 3

* Design: Within-subject design with consent for a fictitious video study
* Procedure:
  - Initial Response: Participants indicate willingness to participate (6-point Likert scale)
  - "No" Response: Provide primary reason (open-ended)
  - "Yes" Response: Describe a scenario for not signing consent
  - Additional Measures: Perceptions of being well-informed and trust in research
  - Feedback: Written feedback from an LLM addressing participant concerns
  - Participants asked again about willingness to participate (6-point Likert scale), feeling informed, and trust
