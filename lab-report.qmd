## Data sharing section in consent

\
\
\

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="62%"}
* Data sharing comes with perceived advantages, disadvantages and uncertainties for researchers [@Stieglitz.etal.2020]<br /><br />
* uncertainty: Fear of 
  - **lower participation** or [@Zuiderwijk.etal.2020]
  - **alternation of behavior** [@Steinhardt.etal.2021]<br />due to data-sharing clauses,<br /><br />
* particularly with 
  - certain **data types** (e.g., interview, video) and [@Lamb.etal.2024]
  - **sensitive** topics

## Evidence so far

\
\
\

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="62%"}

* More general challenge: Participants often **don't read/understand** consent forms [@Geier.etal.2021; @Parfenova.etal.2024; @Pedersen.etal.2011]<br /><br /><br />
* Preliminary evidence
  - **No effect** of data sharing clause on participation [@Fichtner.etal.2023]
  - Even for very **sensitive** topics, participants agree to share data [@Campbell.etal.2023a]<br /><br /><br />
* **Dialogue** about data sharing increases consent[@Campbell.etal.2023]

## Research Questions 


\
\

1. Do participants **read** informed consent forms?<br /><br />
2. Does the information on **sharing data** influence the participants' willingness to participate?<br />`r fa("long-arrow-right")` moderated my **data type**?<br /><br />
3. Does the **option to clarify** concerns about the informed consent make a difference in the willingness to participate?

Do participants **read**  
informed consent forms?
:::




## Study 1
### Design


* **Re-use** of **log-data** from past online surveys, that...
  - measured dwell time on the consent page,
  - allow re-use of their data according to the informed consent<br /><br />
* **Sample**
  - [Teachers, students, ...]
  - $N_{participants} = ...$ participants
  - from $N_{studies} = ...$ online surveys (*[year begin - year end]*)


## Study 1
### Measures


**Dwell time on consent: Reading speed (as words per minute):**

* 238: average (silent) reading speed (English) [@Brysbaert.2019]
* \> 500-600: loss of information/comprehension (skimming)
* \> 900: information falls out of working memory before being comprehended [@Masson.1983]<br /><br />


**Additional coding**

* Which population? [students, teachers, public, researchers, ...]
* Participants incentivized? How? [none, money, ...]
* Topic of study? [sensitive, somewhat sensitive, not sensitive]

## Study 2c

**Concern** | **Response**
--- | ---
*Where and how exactly will my data be stored? How can I be sure my personal data will remain secure and confidential?* | Your personal data will be securely stored on protected servers at a specialized research data center that complies with GDPR standards. Only authorized researchers will have access, following strict data protection protocols to prevent unauthorized use or breaches. Data will be retained for at least 10 years in accordance with research integrity guidelines.
*Will others be able to identify me and relate my data with my person?* | Whenever possible, your data will be anonymized so that no one can identify you. In cases where anonymization is not feasible (e.g., video recordings or interviews), your data will be securely stored in a specialized research data center. Only authorized researchers who submit a request, transparently detailing their intended use of the data, will be granted access. No other individuals will be able to view or use your data.
*What does data sharing mean? Who will have access to my data in the future, and how will it be used?* | If you consent, your data may be stored in a specialized research data center. Researchers who wish to access the data must submit an application detailing their research plan transparently. Only approved researchers will be granted selective access, and they are required to delete the data after completing their analyses. They are not allowed to further distribute the data. Your data will not be shared with commercial entities or used for purposes unrelated to research.
*If I withdraw my consent, what happens to the data that has already been collected? What if my data has already been analyzed or published?* | You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting the research team. After withdrawal, we will ensure that your data is no longer used in the study. This means that any data that can be linked to you will be fully deleted. However, results that have already been published in scientific research reports cannot be removed. In these publications, no one will be able to identify you.
*Could my data be used in ways that I havenât agreed to or that could harm me?* | Your data will only be used for research purposes that align with ethical and legal standards. It will not be shared with third parties for commercial or unauthorized use. Any reuse of your data by other researchers must comply with strict ethical guidelines to prevent misuse. Researchers who wish to access your data must submit a transparent plan detailing their intended use and sign a contract binding them to this specific purpose only. Access will only be granted after signing this contract. They are not permitted to further distribute the data and must delete it after completing their analyses.
*How can I be sure the data are handled ethically?* | This study has been reviewed and approved by an ethics board to ensure that it meets ethical research standards. This includes evaluating potential risks, ensuring informed consent, and safeguarding participants' rights and well-being.

## Questions
\
\

**General:** Idea for a journal? -> registered report?
\

**Study 1:** How to ideally collect log-data from past online surveys -> ask in LLiB?  
\
  
**Study 2:** How to collect participants? Panel provider probably biased  
\
  
**Study 2:** What if participants don't read the fictitious example? -> ecological validity? internal validity?
